## Description
A cloned version of the Lego.com website using Javascript and Angular methods.

## Support and contact details
Feel free to contact me with any suggestions or questions.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Atom, Angular, and webpack

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. git clone: https://github.com/DanBurbach/LegoCloneProject.git

2. Navigate into this repo and download dependencies using manager of your choice: npm install

3. $ np serve --open to run

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further development

- Currently the project is running into errors with routing. Planning on fixing that.
- Incorporate an API pulling from a Lego build database.
- Check to see if Lego has a log in and incorporate that.
- Incorporate better CSS and HTML (to "match" the Lego website)
- If I can, use and incorporate a video API of Lego related material.
